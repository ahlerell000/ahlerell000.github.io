    <p>This weekend local favorite <b>Annie's Burgertown</b> burned down. No one was inside, but repairs will be costly. We have no news on the investagation, but we do have some theories.</p>
    <h3>Worrying Wires</h3>
    <p>It is possible that faulty wiring was the culprite, as a witness commented, <q>I saw a spark from the back, then a loud explosion, I was frozen for a moment before I called 911.</q></p>
    <h3>Nefarious Naughties</h3>
    <p>It is also possible that more dangerous elements are at play here. Local hippie says, <q>Bro, I swear I saw some people back there. Like, we all knew that Annie's was a money maker.</q></p>
